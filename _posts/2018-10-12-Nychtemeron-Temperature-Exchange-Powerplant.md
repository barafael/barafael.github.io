Engineering involves achieving a balance or tradeoff between all the requirements on a system.
Relaxing some constraints on critical aspects can drastically simplify other areas of the design.
This means that identifying areas where such a relaxation can be done without harm is very important.
In this article, I describe an energy powerplant system that I have been thinking about where the relaxation of some constraints may lead to a very simple and effective system to generate mechanical/electrical energy from sunlight.

# Abundant Resources

Heat and light from the sun are some of the most abundant resources available on earth.
Turning them into forms of usable energy at industrial scale promises to solve many problems of present day.
When mining an abundant resource, efficiency is less important.
Space is another plentiful resource.

So lets consider a powerplant that takes a lot of space and is not very energy efficient.
This sounds bad at first, but the relaxation of two critical aspects allows us to pursue others more effectively:

* Complexity
* Cost to produce/construct
* Cost of operation
* Maintenance and Longevity
* Scalability

The Sahara desert offers both vast amounts of free space and reliable solar exposure.
Between day and night, there exist extreme temperature differences which ought to be exploitable for energy generation.

A possible system would use an extremely simple heat collector (a black pipe transporting water) to trap large amounts of heat in a closed-loop water container and store it in insulated storage.
At night, the same collector could provide cool water.
The resulting heat difference may not be enough to make water boil, but it might be enough to be exploitable by a Stirling engine.

Running the system with a phase shift could make sense: as the hot water is used up roughly at midnight, cold water is collected for the day.
When hot water becomes available, it is used until the cold water is used up and then stored for the rest of the day, until cold water becomes available.
Running two such systems in opposite phase might make sense to compensate for the cyclical nature of the process.

A weak point of this design is the lack of industry-scale Stirling engines that can have sufficient power output. But avoiding steam lets us omit mirrors (which have to be kept clean and mechanically functioning) and high-pressure lines
It also allows us to use a closed-loop water system.
Considering the drinking water situation in the countries in and around the sahara, that is a big benefit.

A Stirling engine trades efficiency and weight against safe operation, low maintenance and obliviousness to heat source.
This means that any other heat source may be used should the need arise.

This design may have flaws that I have overlooked. But so far I think even though it is somewhat radical, it might work well.
