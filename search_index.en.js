However, there is a curious behaviour\nin many programming languages where this property does not hold for one special\ncase. You might have come across this if you (like me) tried to (mis)use a\nconstant Integer.MIN_VALUE (or somesuch) to simulate something like negative\ninfinity. For example, this could be useful in a min-max algorithm with\nalpha-beta pruning.\nWhat's the issue?!🔗\nIf you negate the lowest representable int in (for example) java, you could\nexpect it to become Integer.MAX_VALUE. This however, is literally far from the\ntruth! Instead, you get... Integer.MIN_VALUE again. How the flip did that\nhappen?\nIn order to explain this behaviour, we have to dig a bit deeper into the way\nsigned integer numbers are represented in memory:\nTwo's Complement🔗\nIf you already know how Two's Complement works, just skip this. If not, here is\na short explanation:\nIn order to represent both positive and negative numbers, we need to somehow\naccount for the sign of the number we are representing.  This can be done in\nmultiple ways, but Two's Complement has emerged as the most successful\napproach. Basically, numbers are still just binary strings of bits, but the\nMost Significant Bit (MSB) (the bit representing the largest power of 2) counts\nnegatively. For example, if we have the 8-bit binary number 0001 0011, 19\nin decimal, everything is normal because the MSB is zero.  The number 1001 0011 however would be interpreted as (-128) + 16 + 2 + 1, -109 in decimal.\nDetermining the sign of a number becomes very simple: if the MSB is set, the\nnumber is negative. Zero is represented as 0000 0000, negative one as\n1111 1111 (the other 7 bits are needed to offset the large 'negative\nweight'), and the largest positive number is 0111 1111.\nNegating a Number in Two's Complement and Ranges of Representable Numbers🔗\nThe lowest representable number in Two's Complement is 2^(Place of MSB), while\nthe largest number is only 2^(Place of MSB) - 1. That is because the positive\nnumbers also need to include zero.\nNegating a number in Two's Complement is easy using this 'hand rule': start at\nthe right (Least Significant Bit LSB) and copy all zeroes and the first one.\nThen, invert the rest.\nBringing it together🔗\nNow we have everything that is needed to understand the behaviour shown above\nwhere -a = a (with 'a' being some negative number).  There are actually\nat least two ways to understand it, the first one involving the display range\nand the other involving the 'hand rule'.\nIf you invert the lowest representable number with the hand rule, you don't\nfind a '1' until the very end. That means, you copy it and don't invert\nanything! Or, using number ranges: the positive range is one less than the\nnegative range, which means that the lowest number simply cannot be inverted\nwithout exactly one overflow! Which means, we end up at the place we started.\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-3-negating-minimum-representable-number-in-twos-complement/","title":"Negating the minimum representable number in twos complement"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-8-vim-has-no-keyboard-shortcuts/":{"body":"In this StackOverflow\npost,\na question about the 'Most productive Vim keyboard shortcut' sparks a long\ndiscussion about Vim and productivity. In this\nanswer, titled 'Your problem with Vim is\nthat you don't grok vi.' which is easily one of the most influential pieces of\nVim documentation and intro material on the internet, user Jim Dennis takes the\nquestion apart and shows how Vim is not about shortcuts but about a language\nfor manipulating text. If you read and understood this answer, you probably\ndon't need to read this post here, since it is just my personal take on the\nVim philosophy.\n'Shortcuts' and Vim🔗\nA shortcut in any other program is like a certain event that causes the program\nto do a certain action. Like F5 in a browser or CTRL+D in most\nterminals.\nIn Sublime Text, there is a shortcut to delete a line: CTRL+UP+K. This\ncannot be remembered easily, involves CTRL, is generally hard to do and\nimpossible with just one hand (yes, I know there is also CTRL+X). In Vim,\nthe same action happens on dd. This seems arbitrary too, but actually it\nfits well into the rest of the vim language, where 'd' means to delete\nsomething and a double tap means to apply an action on an entire line.\nMoreover, this command can be combined with others as in a real programming\nlanguage and has the side effect of storing the line in some register. This is\nnot a shortcut, but an action from the language that makes up the way you\nmanipulate text in vim.\nActions and Macros🔗\nThe fact that actions in vim can be randomly made up on the fly indefinitely,\nand combined with each other, is already very powerful. But there are even more\nbenefits: since a text edit is just a sequence of characters constituting the\naction, the use of a macro is simply recording and playing back such a sequence\nof characters. Because vim is awesome, it stores a macro in some register\n(bearing the name you gave to the macro) so you can easily access, save for\nlater, or modify the actions a macro does. You can also call a macro from\nitself for multi-line edits - to vim it is simply a long chain of characters\nthat it must interpret. Macros can be nested - you can call a macro b from\nwithin macro a since macro invocation is only a sequence of characters.\nFinally, it is easy to parameterize macros with register contents.\nFor example, you might have a macro 'a' that finds a word matching a certain\npattern and yanks it to register 'w', and then calls a macro 'b' which finds\nanother word and substitutes the contents of the 'w' register. This could be\ndone with regex back references, but to do it with macros in vim feels much\ncleaner to me - it is like programming with functions.\nWhy all the ramble about Macros?🔗\nBecause all the other text editors which use shortcuts cannot really do this\nand that is precisely the benefit of not having shortcuts, duh!\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-8-vim-has-no-keyboard-shortcuts/","title":"VIM has no keyboard shortcuts"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/a-platform-agnostic-driver-for-ebyte-e32-lora-modules/":{"body":"Radio communication is not easy, right?

His alternative perspective using\nbuckets and offsets is brilliant and explains a fact that may be\noverlooked when using the standard explanation: the accuracy of floating point\nnumbers declines with a factor of 2 by each bucket!  That is because the same\n'amount' of numbers is dispersed in any bucket, but the size of the bucket\ndoubles every time.\nI wanted to empirically show this and wrote this short C program:\n\nOne reason Unions are useful🔗\nThis program uses a C union. Unions allow you to use the same memory for\nmultiple members, and every time you write one member, it also changes the\nothers. This may seem useless, but it is not. In this case, it allows you to\nwrite to memory using the memory representation of float, while reading the\nsame content of memory as individual bits. The union has 2 members, one\nallowing to write and read a float, the other resembling the bit pattern of a\nfloat as defined in the IEEE754 Norm. After writing to the float, you can\nread and manipulate the exponent and mantissa from the embedded struct.\nPrinting any memory content as binary [print_any(content pointer, size)]🔗\nCasting the pointer to the memory content to a byte pointer (uint8_t *)\nallows us to index individual bytes. To access individual bits, we need to\ngenerate a bit mask for each of them. We simply start at 0b1000 0000 and\nkeep shifting left while using the index to access a single bit and print it.\nSince the bit at position n will still be interpreted as being of value 2^n\nwe need to check if it is set and print a 1 if this is the case, hence the\nternary operator.\nWe need this function to inspect a floating point number.\nFloating point numbers are discrete, too... [increase_float(content)]🔗\nWe imagine floats as being very fine-grained. That is exactly what they are -\nthey do not allow for arbitrary accuracy, they are not what mathematicians\nwould call dense.\nThat means, we can take a float and increase it by exactly one tiny amount,\nyielding the next-larger float in that bucket! That is what the function\nincrease_float does.\nWe construct a float_parts union using the float as content. Then, we look\nat the mantissa: if it is filled to the brim, we reset it to 0 and increase the\nexponent by one. Otherwise, we simply increase the mantissa.\nPutting it together: How accuracy declines with growing exponent [print_accuracy(low, high)]🔗\nHere we keep increasing a float, and when the 'step size' changes, we log it.\nWe also print the factor between the last and the current step size.\nThis function runs way faster than I expected for some reason - it visits every\nfloat there is between low and high.\nThere you have it!

Then:\nTransforming the Cosine Function🔗\nPlugging the Cosine into the definition of the Fourier Transform🔗\n\nSo we see that the spectrum of the cosine is comprised of two other certain spectra, which are shifted in time.\nBut what is the fourier transform of 1?🔗\nThis can be approached using intuition. Given that the value of the spectrum of a function at frequency  is equal to the mean of the function:\n\nWe can conclude that our spectrum is infinite at 0.

If we scale a function like that, we can try to imagine what will happen to the spectrum of the function: if we increase the frequency (), we stretch the spectrum to accomodate the higher spectral components, and if we decrease the frequency (), we compress the spectrum because there are now lower spectral components.

It is perfectly fine to write high-level Rust code without knowing what a data race is (that is the freedom Rust grants) but understanding the underlying issue makes the compiler error messages more understandable.\nTo explain some of the problems Rust solves, I have collected examples to show and explain specific problems and see what rustc(\"the Rust complainer\") has to say about them.\nLet's start simple: Dereferencing Null Pointers🔗\nWhen Tony Hoare finished implementing ALGOL 60 in 1965, he couldn't know that he would be apologizing for one of its concepts 44 years later: at '09 QCon in London, he called null pointers a 'billion dollar mistake.'\nLanguages since have picked up variations of the concept. For example, Java has no pointers accessible to the programmer, yet it has a NullPointerException.\nLet's look at a simple C example of a null pointer dereference:\n\nWe create a pointer to an int with the value of NULL. When we try to write to that location, a SIGSEGV happens to happen on my machine and setup, but dereferencing a NULL pointer is undefined behavior, meaning that anything could happen.\nHow does this look in Rust? Simply put, safe Rust has no null references. There is no way to express this in safe Rust.\nThere is always unsafe:\n\nWith this code, I happen to get a SIGSEGV, too.\nAnd now for something more interesting: Free of 'use-after-free'🔗\nUnlike many other languages, we have to explicitly request and release our memory from/to the operating system when working with C.\nThose actions still happen when using Java, Python, or Haskell, but they happen automatically in the background. This is safe (because it is automatic), and it is very comfortable for the programmer. However, such garbage collection has a cost, which is out of scope for this article but frequently discussed.\nManaging memory manually (like it is done in most systems programming languages) is a difficult problem because we have to ensure that:\n\nall allocated memory is free()'d (no memory leaks)\nmemory that was free()'d before is never reused (no use-after-free)\nmemory is free()'d exactly once in all code paths of the program (no double free)\n\nIf we fail to do this, our program might crash, or worse, it might corrupt data anywhere or present opportunities to attackers.\nThe free function in C deallocates previously allocated blocks of memory, but it does not invalidate our pointer to that memory - we can still use it:\n\nWe allocate a 16-byte block, which we then pass to the fgets function to read user input. After printing that input, we free the buffer.\nNothing in the C language stops us from using that pointer again!\nLet's see what this would look like in Rust:\n\nAll the Rust compiler has to say is:\n\nThe error message uses some Rust-specific language (move? Copy trait?), but it is pretty clear: ownership of the buffer is moved into drop(), after which the buffer is not usable.\nIt is important to note that the drop function is used rarely in Rust. That is because every object is destructed automatically at the point where its owner's scope ends (which is known at compile time).\nRegardless, the function exists, and it is one of the most beautiful functions in the standard library:\n\nThat's all they wrote: take ownership of an _x of an unconstrained type T, and go out of scope, resulting in the deterministic deconstruction of _x.\nBut what about std::move?🔗\nModern C++ introduced moving ownership. The move constructor invalidates the old owner in some agreed-upon way, even if the object is const. After the move, the old pointer may still be used (but that is not a good idea!).\n\nNote that a moved-from object (that is not trivially destructible) still has to be destroyed: http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/why-moving-an-object-does-not-destroy-th/231601451\nRust has moves and ownership baked deep into the language:\n\nThe Rust compiler comments:\n\nTypes implementing the Copy-trait are similar to 'primitive datatypes' in java. They are passed by value (or 'by copy').\nBut copying is a quick operation only for a few basic types! For any other type, the explicit clone method can be used, if the type implements the Clone trait. This is unlike C++, where an implicit copy of an object often occurs, without any special syntax.\nThe Many Kinds Of Dangling Pointers🔗\nDangling Pointer Into Heap🔗\nIn C-like languages, we can use the addresses of objects on the heap or stack directly. This is powerful, but it means we have to be cautious about the memory at the other end of a pointer:\n\nThis program allocates a buffer on the heap, creates a pointer into that buffer, then frees the buffer. However, the pointer still exists! That is a dangling pointer into the heap. Let's reconstruct this in Rust:\n\nThe compiler interjects! Error message:\n\nThe message is clear. How dare we move the ownership of the variable array to drop if we still have borrowed it to reference?\nCapturing Closures🔗\nClosures are anonymous functions which can capture variables from their originating scope.\nTherefore, if we create a string variable some_string and a closure some_closure in one scope, we can use some_string from some_closure.\nClosures would be pointless if we could not pass them around different scopes! That is dangerous, though:\n\nThe function get_lambda_with_local_reference will return a function&lt;int(int)&gt;, which is a lambda that takes and returns an int.\nThat function is defined in the last line of get_lambda_with_local_reference as returning the sum of its argument and the element at index index of an array defined in the same (stack frame) scope.\nWhen we return the lambda, this array goes out of scope. When we call it, the lambda dereferences some random value from the stack (at best).\nSame story in Rust:\n\nThe Rust Complainer says NO:\n\nrustc also suggests how to fix the problem, as seen in the function get_lambda_with_moved_reference.\nMore dangling pointers🔗\nYou can find more examples of less interesting dangling pointers here.\nCrossing Boundaries or: yet another 'Billion Dollar Mistake'🔗\nFor performance reasons, the creators of the C language used raw pointers to memory blocks as array types. After creating an array, it's size has to be tracked manually, often by something like #define BUF_SIZE 256. Array access by index, like arr[115], happens without checking bounds. One could check manually.\nSimilarly, strings (which are just char pointers) always end with a \\0-byte. The performance benefits come with a price - it is incredibly easy to make a mistake:\n\nJust one character too much - the '=' in the for loop exit condition causes our index to reach one element past the buffer boundaries.\nThis is easy to catch. But there are other possible buffer overruns which are even in the C library:\n\nWriting a string into the buffer that is larger than the buffer can corrupt the password flag and grant us privileged access!\nAnd yes, you should not use gets, as the compiler may tell us here. So, let's use fgets, but hide a mistake in our code:\n\nThe fundamental problem is that the array size is unknown. There may be a performance advantage to not having those runtime index bounds checks, but modern LLVM is good at optimizing those away. Either way, bounds checks should be an opt-out feature for critical loops, not an opt-in by manually coding them in my opinion.\nObligatory Rust example:\n\nThis code panics with 'index out of bounds' at runtime. Rust cannot catch that kind of bug at compile time (it is hard to catch in the general case)!\nThe Real Fun Stuff: Access to Shared Data🔗\nData races can happen if these 3 conditions are met: (1) multiple parts of a program have access to the same memory (sharing), (2) at least one of them writes to the shared data (mutation), and (3) there is no mechanism in place to ensure proper order of transactions (synchronization).\nTo wrap everything in mutexes and semaphores is one viable option, but Rust offers a safer and faster option: ensuring the first 2 conditions are never true at the same time. This is what \"Sharing XOR mutation\" means: either many processes read, or at most one writes. It turns out the borrow checker that ensures memory errors never happen also prevents many issues arising from shared access to resources because there is always a clear owner and it is known if and how data is shared.\nHere is what a multithreaded C++ program could look like:\n\nWe give the data race some time to occur. What happens is not deterministic, but the second transaction is sometimes just swallowed by the void.\nWe have met all 3 of the above conditions!\nTo fix the problem, we might use an atomic type for balance, however, not even cppcheck or clang-tidy warn us here.\nTranslating the same to Rust:\n\nThe error message here is quite long because there are so many mistakes from the Rust compiler's point of view.\nMore examples🔗\nA few more examples can be found here.\nA solution for C and C++: great linters🔗\nThe cppcheck and clang-tidy have heuristics for many of the problems listed here. Often, their explanation of the problem is excellent, as well.\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/how-the-rust-compiler-prevents-mistakes/","title":"How the Rust Compiler prevents mistakes"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/how-to-communicate-failure-in-rust/":{"body":"Basics explained well in this blog post: Rust Error Handling.\nThe linked blog post shows how to manually create boxed errors and error enums.\nBoxed Errors🔗\nUse boxed errors if you have a very wide set of sources which could produce errors (wide as in, many crates or many modules). Why? Because boxing an error is simple, but makes it harder to handle for the layer above you.\nError Enums🔗\nA custom error enum is the way to go if you want the user of the code you are working on to be able to check what exactly failed. You do have to create an enum variant for all the different error conditions.

The vector of filter coefficients will be called a \"filter window\" from here on.\nFiltering a signal can be achieved like this:\n\n(This explanation is probably very engineer-like and insufficient for mathematicians. What can I do.)\nA simple example: set all values of the filter to . Then a sample in a filtered signal is the arithmetic mean of the samples around it, removing high-frequency content.\nProperties of Filters🔗\nNotice the filter coefficients in the previous example where . Otherwise, we might modify the energy of the signal. Obviously, you don't want a filtered signal to be amplified or diminished. This kind of filter is called \"Energy-Preserving\".\nThere are many more properties, one of which is linearity. A linear filter has the property that you can apply it to a sum of signals and get the same result as applying it to each  signal individually and then summing the result. Put in another way:\nLet  and  . Then:\n\nThis property will become important later.\nThe Unit Impulse and why it is important🔗\nThe Unit Impulse function (or dirac delta) is... not actually a function, but a distribution.

It's Fourier Transform is... just :\n\nIn other words, we can get a unit impulse by summing up cosines of ever-increasing frequency.\nSo what happens if we apply a filter to a unit impulse?\nWell, by the linearity property stated above, that would be the same as applying the filter to each of the frequencies the unit impulse is comprised of - which is, all of them.\nYou read that right - with the unit impulse, we can see what a filter does to ANY frequency.\nDoes it diminish high frequency? Only the low frequencies from the impulse get through.\nIs there a band that the filter attenuates? Those frequencies will be dimmed in the result. By the way, the result of applying a filter to a unit impulse is aptly called the \"Impulse Response\".\nNow, let's think about the Fourier Transform of an impulse response.\nThe impulse response contains every frequency with the amplitude that the filter permits for this frequency.\nSo it's spectral content directly displays how the filter behaves for a given frequency.\nI will denote the impulse response  of a filter  with .\nConvolution and Filter Application🔗\nNow let's clarify why applying filters can be achieved by Convolution. The best explanation I found is rather mathematical, but somewhat easy to understand.\nFirst, let's look at a signal  in a slightly contrived way:\n\nEquivalently, where :\n\nWhich is to say: you can picture a signal at a point as a unit impulse shifted to exactly that point multiplied with the entire signal.\nNow let's see what happens if we apply a filter  to that signal and simplify the result.\n\nAnd there you have it! Applying a filter to a signal is the same as multiplying the transformed signal with the transfer function and taking the inverse Fourier Transform of the result:\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/impulse-response-and-transfer-function/","title":"Impulse Response and Transfer Function"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/load-bearing-oneliners-in-the-rust-standard-library/":{"body":"The Rust language tries to be as minimal as possible.\nMany crucial features and design decisions aren't compiler magic, instead they live in core or other parts of the standard library.\nHere are some:\nShared References are Copy (look don't touch)🔗\nThe core::marker::Copy trait marks a type which can be safely copied by simply copying its bits.\nThink bool, f64, Duration, or SocketAddr.\nA shared reference can obviously be copied.

In fact, if you're gonna read one article, read Alice's article.\n\nI believe that an actor should be its data🔗\nAlice's post starts off with a recipe, briefly introducing the style by example.\nAlthough the principle remains, I suggest a few changes.\nIn the original recipe, the actor holds its state and its receiver.\nWhat if an actor consisted solely of its plain-old-data state?\n\nAn actor should not own channel handles or sockets or other I/O resources.\nIt may require them as arguments for its event loop of course! But not hold them as members.\nOwnership is responsibility, and who is really responsible for the run-time resources of the actor? The actor's event loop (see below).\n\nNote: Holding simple data as actor state also simplifies restarting an actor after it broke out of its event loop: all you have to do is create new runtime resources and start the event loop again.\n\nI prefer the Event Loop as consuming method🔗\nSomewhat differently to the original recipe, I prefer this particular event loop signature:\n\nNotably, the event loop is a method consuming and returning Self.\nIt can be spawned as a task, but doesn't have to.\nBy returning Self, we can inspect the state after the event loop finished, and even re-enter it.\nAnd, we can assert that the correct target actor state has been reached in a unit test.\nI like to leave the spawning to the user🔗\nThe original recipe tokio::spawns the actor event loop in a helper function.\nBut who are we to assume that particular use? One may want to:\n\nawait the end of the event loop (without spawning),\nspawn, then monitor the tokio::task::JoinHandle&lt;_&gt;,\ncreate the actor event loop future and put it in something like a FuturesUnordered along with its brethren, or\nspawn the event loop future on a non-tokio executor.\n\nThat's not to say you should not spawn the event loop onto some kind of task.\nSpawning is great, and it lets an actor run free (employing parallelism) in its own little world (no foreign references, in or out).\nI don't believe in actor handles🔗\nThe original recipe recommends to implement an actor handle type.\nPerhaps surprisingly, I have stopped writing actor handle types!\nIn my opinion, actor handles paper too much over the operations on the channel handle to the actor.\nI feel they obscure what is actually happening and prevent us from doing cool shit. We can't\n\nawait the termination of the actor (unless we forward mpsc::Sender::closed of the underlying sender handle)\nstore the response futures (oneshot::Receivers) in a combinator (see unit test),\nuse the actor handle from a blocking context,\n... much more cool shit.\n\nIn short, all the methods implemented on the mpsc::Sender are there for good reasons, but our handle is hiding them.\nMy suggestion if you really want to reduce boilerplate anyway is to use associated functions on the actor (UniqueIdService) type:\n\nI recommend to not fold in the oneshot::Receiver like in the original handle implementation!\nBy holding the receiver, you can collect and await it at your convenience.\nFor an example, see the unit test.\n Unit Testing the UniqueIdService🔗\nI have found that actors which aren't easy to test hint at bad architecture. The interfaces should be clear, and all the other parties an actor talks to should not need to be mocked:\nthe communication medium is some channel,\nso one only needs to create such a channel and enqueue the correct messages on it (before running the event loop, see below).\nCare must be taken to not run into timing-dependent behaviour in a unit test (and please avoid at great cost situations where you put a sleep call in your test! It reeks.\nThere is no way to ensure real-time constraints within tokio naively, so don't pretend there is by bounding the execution time of your function under test).\nThe actor interface as-is enables us to write a test with a deterministic order of events,\nbecause we don't need to spawn a task running your actor and then send messages to it.\nInstead, we enqueue the messages, then drop the sender.\nOnly then, we await the event loop. Here we encounter \"natural actor shutdown\". We can assert on the resulting final state.\n\n\nNote: The event loop returns Self. This means, even if you do need to spawn it, .awaiting the tokio::task::JoinHandle&lt;UniqueIdService&gt; yields your actor state.\n\n\nNote: One should generally, but especially in tests, await the completion of tasks somehow, if only to assert they did not panic. If you can, avoid placing asserts in test-only tasks.\n\nFull Example\nRuling out Deadlocks with Bounded Channels🔗\nAttempting to send a message on a tokio bounded mpsc channel is async, because the channel might be filled to the bound.\nIn that case, sending will \"suspend\" until space becomes available.\nThis is great, because it introduces backpressure.\nIn normal operation, the mpsc queue compensates flow rate differences between sending and receiving.\nHowever, imagine a situation where actor A sends actor B messages, while actor B sends actor A messages:\n\nWith both channels being bounded, the queue from A to B could become filled-to-the-bound.\nThen, A would be blocked until B processes the next message, meaning A would process no messages.\nIf B now sends messages to A, they would not be processed, filling the channel to the bound.\nYikes! Deadlock.\nThis situation is bad in another way, even if the deadlock never arises.\nThe actor cycle prevents natural actor shutdown of A and B, because there always exists a handle to each receiver.\nA and B are engaged in a sort of toxic nepotistic double binding.\n\nNote: Strive for your channel topology to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (see below).\n\nMessage enums are great🔗\nI have not changed a thing about the message type in the original recipe, because it's timeless.\nRemember to make your messages own your data - don't borrow.\n\nNote: A message is a way to transfer ownership from one actor to another, thereby transferring the responsibility to handle the data. Borrowing indicates time-coupling of components, which would defeat the purpose of autonomously running actors, so don't do it. Don't worry, if you do it, you'll end in lifetime soup and back out, anyway.\n\n\nMore Note: Sounds like a V-Table? Not a coincidence.\n\nOn Call-and-Response🔗\nMost actors in my experience do not require and should not employ the call-response pattern demonstrated in this example. It's a sort of sync-async crossover anyway, and blocks the \"calling\" actor (when implemented naively). Look at the original post under the \"No responses to messages\" heading.Most actors I have seen simply take \"Commands\", i.e. messages carrying the plain-old-data to be processed.\nThe most fun designs I have been with did not use the pattern at all, and data flowed only left-to-right. This is good for a number of reasons, notably it prevents the biggest footgun of bounded mpsc channels and facilitates automatic application shutdown.\nI like \"Natural Actor Shutdown\"🔗\nThe actor scheme presented here still employs one of the most important aspects of the original design, which is \"natural actor shutdown\":\n\nWe exit when recving on the channel yields None.\nAs per the docs, this happens when\nthere are no more messages in the mpsc::Receiver queue, and\nthere are no more mpsc::Senders.\nIn this situation, all messages have been handled, and no more senders can ever be created.\nAfter exiting the event loop, but before returning from the function, an actor may run asynchronous cleanup logic\n(such as unsubscribing from a message broker or closing a websocket connection).\nAfter cleaning up, the event loop shall drop all runtime resources.\nOther actors may then realize this situation and perform their own natural shutdown.\nIf your entire system topology is a DAG, you can achieve graceful shutdown by dropping the \"top-level handle\".\n\n\nNote: If the task was spawned and isn't being joined somewhere, all actor resources are dropped. This includes channel handles of other actors.\n\n\nMore Note: Sounds like garbage collection? Not a coincidence.\n\nWhat about Explicit Shutdown?🔗\nAn actor should generally detect the condition where it is no longer needed and shut down by breaking out of its event loop.\nI prefer this over explicitly shutting down an actor.\nIdeally, shutdown naturally happens gracefully when each actor finishes processing and drops its actor handles.\nSome designs do require distributing a tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken among the components, though.\nThere is no Rust Actor Framework, and it's called tokio🔗\nAs a personal opinion of mine, and perhaps a spicy take: don't use an actor framework.\nThe ones I have seen are bad abstractions over tokio::spawn and overly restrictive.\nDon't make a Heartbeat Actor🔗\nIf your actor has the sole purpose of periodically announcing itself to the world, something is wrong.\nIf all other actors in the system are stuck or bogged down slow, should that heartbeat actor still run free? No.\nThe only thing better than an actor: no actor🔗\nIf you can avoid an actor, do so. Try to delete as many actors from your design as possible.\nToo many times I have observed that after an initial design, by deleting stuff from it, one can arrive at a beautiful final design.\nIf a region of your design doesn't feel right or look nice, trust your gut: try to find the root cause of the strangeness, then try to eliminate it.\nYou may, like me, uncover corners that are incidentally complex and can be fixed.\nRefuse to start implementation until you understand the problem (mind the \"unreasonable effectiveness of understanding the problem\").\n\"Original OOP\" (OOOP)🔗\nFamously, Alan Kay \"didn't have C++ in mind\" when coining the term \"OOP\" (Object Oriented Programming).\nThis means inheritance, overloading, and a class keyword are completely besides the point!\nBut what did he have in mind?\n\nOOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.\nAlan Kay in Dr. Alan Kay on the Meaning of “Object-Oriented Programming”.\n\n\nMessaging: Passing data items along channels.\nlocal retention of state-process: in the event loop future, it's impossible to access any state. The message handler cannot be called from the outside once the event loop is running (not even if it were public).\nlocal protection of state-process: a tokio task is a panic boundary. An actor may crash, and the crash is observable from the outside, but it is recoverable. A panic cannot poison another actors' data because a message cannot contain (non-static) references.\nhiding of state-process: actor state and message handler are private (not pub).\nextreme late-binding of all things: actors are bound at spawn-time to other actors via channel handles. As discussed, a sender handle with a certain message type is like a v-table. Whatever is behind it only must know the message type. This is more late-bound than even Box&lt;dyn ...&gt;, probably as late-bound as you can get in Rust.\n\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/more-actors-with-tokio/","title":"More Actors with Tokio"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/nice-error-handling-with-arduino-blinking-led-patterns/":{"body":"Errors (not human errors, but literally error conditions) can happen very\nquickly even in simple Arduino projects.

This can be done by having a global pointer to a class instance which is valid for the lifetime of the instance. If you attach your interrupts and set this pointer in your constructor you should be fine. Remember to detach the interrupts and set the pointer to NULL or nullptr in the destructor, if this applies to your program.\nExample Code: Simple library to interface an Arduino or Teensy device to an RC Receiver🔗\nHere is the code:\n\nFor a possibly more up-to-date version: github repo.\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/object-oriented-arduino-interrupts-using-c-friend-functions/","title":"Object-Oriented Arduino interrupts: using C++ Friend Functions"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/programming-the-teensy-3-2-using-a-makefile/":{"body":"The Arduino toolchain is a good starting point.

It can control\nPWM-based actuators like servos or LEDs and electronic speed controllers\ndriving brushless motors. This control is based on an external signal like the\noutput from an RC receiver, and the output of an inertial measurement unit.\nThat means you can use this controller to stabilise or balance small vehicles\nlike planes, multicopters, VTOLs, hydrofoils, hovercraft, or rockets...\nTo get the most use out of this article, you should have a basic understanding\nabout PID, standard RC components like ESCs (electronic speed controllers),\nbrushless motors, RX/TX, and some C/C++ programming skills.\nWhy use PID for balance control?🔗\nA PID controller governs a system so that the difference between a setpoint and\na measured value is minimized, effectively driving our system to where we want\nit to be. Note that anything measurable and 'steerable' (that is at least\nsomewhat linear) can be fed into a PID controller, like temperature, position,\naltitude, force... Using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to give us our\nmeasurement, we can generate an output signal that depends on the attitude and\nangular velocity of our system.\nIn quadcopters, planes, and many other vehicle types, we have to constantly\nmonitor and manipulate the attitude, thrust, velocity and similar parameters to\nachieve the desired result. To influence those parameters, there are control\nsurfaces, levers or propellers/jets which inflict forces on our craft in any\nnecessary degree of freedom.\nThose propellers and levers generally control rates too - rate of rotation,\nrate of climb, etc. That makes them ideal for being governed by a PID\ncontroller.\nCascaded PID🔗\nIt is useful to use not only one but two PID controllers because the sensor\noutput from the gyroscope is way faster than the output from the sensor fusion\nalgorithm that fuses gyroscope and accelerometer data and produces an accurate\nattitude estimation. Gyroscope data drifts only over time, whereas\naccelerometer data does not drift but is subject to high-frequency noise. We\ncan cascade the controllers: the first loop receives the setpoint interpreted\nas attitude and the currently most accurate estimation of the attitude and\nproduces a needed angular rate as a result. This rate is fed into another loop\nas setpoint, and this rate loop receives the faster angular rate readings from\nthe gyroscope directly. If the second loop executes more often, then it will\nensure that the overall loop rate is fast and not limited by the time it takes\nto fuse the IMU data.\nThe setpoint can either be interpreted as a desired absolute angle or as a\ndesired angular rate. In the first case, the PID controller will attempt to\nstabilize the craft to this angle, whereas in the second case, it will try to\nrotate the vehicle at the given rate. This is known as 'rate mode' or 'acro\nmode' in some flight controllers.\nTo achieve 'rate mode', the attitude loop simply needs to be ignored. A\nconstant input on the roll stick of a plane in rate mode would result in a\ncontinuous roll, or a multicopter yaw stick would control the rate of\nz-rotation of the copter. In 'stabilize mode', a constant stick deviation is\nmapped to a constant vehicle deviation.\nHardware🔗\nI am using a Teensy 3.2 as the brains. It has an ARM Cortex M4 chip that can\nbe overclocked to 120MHz which is more than sufficient for this control task.\nThe board also has plenty of GPIO pins and can tolerate a wide range of supply\nvoltages (such as 5V from a standard RC electronic speed controller) with its\ninternal voltage regulator.\nAs IMU sensor, I previously used the widely available and familiar MPU6050. This\nsensor offers measurement of absolute orientation as well as angular rates from\nthe gyroscope and provides data moderately quickly using the I2C protocol.\nBut now I am using\nKris Winers EM-SENtral-based 'Ultimate Fusion Solution'\nwhich has proven to be extremely fast and accurate, if a bit expensive. The\nsample rate for accelerometers and gyroscopes is set 1kHz for now. The\nproprietary sensor fusion in the SENtral processor reacts extremely quick to\nchanges in angular position. I chose to let the sensors do their fusion for now\nbecause it is initially very simple, but I would like to use one of the newer\nInvensense sensors (ICM-20608, ICM-40602) and implement my own Kalman/Madgwick\nfilter at some point. The ICM-40602 improves on the previous generation mostly\nin energy consumption, which is completely irrelevant in this case.\nAs basic peripheral hardware (actuators), any standard ESCs, servos and TX/RX\ncombo using PWM should work.\nFour simple steps🔗\nHere are the steps that need to be done to stabilize and control:\n\nRead input from the RC receiver\nRead sensor values from IMU\nCalculate PID response with those measurements as input\nWrite the result to the connected actuators, using predefined weights\n\nReading input from the receiver🔗\nThe receiver sends pulses of varying on-time corresponding to the stick\npositions to our board. Using interrupts, we can measure the time passing\nbetween a rising edge and a falling edge of one signal, which should always be\nroughly within 1000us and 2000us (RC standard). We can simply hook an interrupt\nto each input pin, log the system time on a rising flank, and calculate the\nduration in microseconds since rising flank when the signal is falling again.\nThe code for this is in src/PWMReceiver.cpp. PPM, which is conceptually\nsimilar but needs only one wire, is also implemented in\nsrc/PPMReceiver.cpp. All receiver interfaces should implement virtual\nfunctions in include/Receiver.h.\nRace Copters, Not Conditions🔗\nThe duration measurement from our interrupt routines is written each time the\ninterrupt routine executes on a falling edge. That means, we have to be\ncareful when reading those values! I used shared volatile variables which are\nwritten to by the interrupts to store the measurements. The main loop copies\nthe data to variables which it can use undisturbed. This way, it is always\nclear that the interrupt writes while the main loop reads the shared variables.\nWhen the variables are read, no interrupts are allowed since they might\noverwrite the values while reading them, violating the 'sharing XOR mutability'\nprinciple and thus inviting race conditions.\nFor a really good description on how to read RC receiver PPM output, have look\nat\nthis excellent article by Ryan Boland.\nHe explains it better than I will ever be able to - and with oscilloscope\nscreenshots!\nRead sensor values from IMU🔗\nReading the measurements and computation results from the 'Ultimate IMU\nSolution' is done in a similar way like in Kris Winers example program, however\nI adapted large parts to skip software sensor fusion and provide an\nobject-oriented interface to the sensor.\nCalculate PID response🔗\nThis is where the magic happens, but it is actually very simple. The PID\nalgorithm in this discrete form (really the one everyone uses) is short and\nsweet, using the \"poor man's derivative (-)\" and the \"poor man's integral (+)\".\nSome smoothing is applied to the D term (if enabled), but I am unsure if this\nis actually beneficial.\nI adapted some ideas presented in\nBrett Beauregard's series \"Improving the beginners PID\"\nEventually, PID coefficients will depend on the currently chosen mode (if I get\nto the implementation).\nWrite result to connected actuators🔗\nThe output is basically finished. It only needs to be scaled a bit and then\nwritten out using the various output methods defined in\nsrc/ESCOutput.cpp, src/ServoOutput.cpp and\nsrc/FastPWMOutput.cpp.  Eventually, this will need more work: depending\non the current flight mode, output mixer volumes will have to be chosen for\neach output channel. Possible parameters for the output channel mixers are\nthrottle, roll/pitch/yaw attitude PID output, roll/pitch/yaw rate output,\nrate/stabilize mode, and even motor type (servo/ESC).\nThis is basically a Matrix-vector multiplication. Each output is the weighted\nsum of the RC inputs and the PID controlling values in each axis. Since we have\n8 outputs and 8+3 (currently) values that influence them, there are 8 rows and\n11 columns in our matrix.  The input vector consists of 8 receiver inputs + 3\nPID control values. The i-th row of the matrix consists of the weights for each\noutput for the j-th control value.\nThis is a bit complex, but essentially it allows us to say: \"This output reacts\nto the throttle stick with a factor of 0.8, and to the yaw pid value with a\nfactor of 0.1.\" Additionally, we can store a matrix for each flight mode, and\ntransition from one matrix to the next smoothly while transitioning flight\nmodes.\nWhere is the catch? Well, none of this is implemented... The matrix\nmultiplication part can be done in\nunder a microsecond(!) on the teensy 3.5\nusing the capabilities of the Cortex M4. That is an interesting challenge and I\nhope I will get to it.\nAll of this depends on getting the PID and IMU and Output implementations to\nwork with 16 bit fixed-point numbers, and never floats.\nGive me the Code!🔗\nThe code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/barafael/raPID\nFurther Ideas/Inspiration🔗\nI am thinking about allowing for several different flight/operation modes which\nconsist mostly of a set of PID-coefficients and settings for mixers on each\nactuator output. A mixer would control how much impact each PID output should\nhave on each actuator output.\nTransitioning between flight modes could interpolate the values of the two\nmixers so that modes transition smoothly into each other.\nIf this transitional flight mode interpolation sounds familiar to you, it might\nbe because of\nOpenAeroVTOL.\nIt runs (really well) on the\nHobbyking KK2.1.5 Multi-Rotor LCD Flight Control Board.\nThere is active and friendly support on the RCgroups forums, and it is often\nstated that this board is able to stabilize almost anything small-scale.\nHowever, development is confined by the hardware used (who knows for how long\nHK will be making the kk-board), the development style (code drops on release\nby the single author every couple months), and the word 'VTOL' in the name. It\nwould be nice to really have a general controller not for just one niche,\nsacrificing some features (Tailsitter option, Heli-style rotor control) for a\nmore general approach (also with more than the 3 flight modes which OAV has).\nAdditionally, OAV does not support a derivative gain (the D in PID), arguing\nthat this form of feedback is unnecessary for vehicles that naturally have a\nhigh damping factor due to having a higher mass or large wings. The accuracy of\nthis statement is debatable, and to provide a more general approach a D gain is\nnice to have (if only for meta-stable systems or niche cases like multicopters).\nAnother feature of OAV is that it can entirely be configured via the onboard\nLCD screen (that is a miracle, really). Since version 1.5, you may also use\n(exclusively) Microsoft Excel to configure it, using a macro-based GUI in .xlsx\nformat (yes, really). I am not at the point to even think about this by a long\nshot, but it would be nice to have a graphical configuration interface on a\ncomputer that can set options on the board over a serial or even wireless\nconnection.\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/remote-control-vehicle-balance-controller/","title":"Remote Control vehicle balance controller"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/statements-and-expressions-in-rust/":{"body":"In this post, we will explore how Rust distinguishes between expressions and statements.\nEven though this distinction seems very theoretical, it has wide-ranging implications on the Rust language and (in my opinion) is a beautiful detail of Rust.\nTerms and Conditions🔗\nWhat do I mean by expressions and statements?\nArithmetic terms like (a + 3) / 2, or a condition (a &amp; !b) | (!a &amp; b) are expressions. Evaluating them yields some (non-empty-)value like 3 or true. This is what functional programmers mean when they say their whole program is basically one large mathematical term which is evaluated. It is important to note that evaluating an expression in this mode of thinking has no effect on the outside world, or 'context'.\nTo interact with the world, we need statements. A statement could be motor.drive(100), where drive(int) is a void function which changes the context such that something in the real world reflects this effect (like writing to an output port).\nWhat's in a '{}'-Block?🔗\nLanguages like C and Java use curly braces to denote scope. In Rust, curly braces mark a scope too, but they can also evaluate to a value. This value can be empty '()', though. Let's see some examples:\n\n\nThe syntax appears very similar, but this is a false lookalike: we can evaluate expressions in blocks.\n\nThis is a very structured solution to the frequent problem of conditionally assigning/binding values to variables.\nIt should be noted that a semicolon suppresses the value of an expression. This is why we do not have semicola after 3 or some_action(), but after the last curly brace.\nRetiring the Ternary Operator🔗\nThis C shorthand for an if-else-block as expression:\n\ndoes not require special syntax in Rust.\n\nNote that in the Rust snippet, each branch of the if statement evaluates to a number.\nThe Point of 'No Return'🔗\nUsing the return keyword is discouraged sometimes in the Rust community. It makes no difference for the program, but omitting it fits better with the 'Everything is an Expression' mode of thinking. This becomes apparent when looking at the following examples, which may look scary for some C programmers.\n\nThe exit point of a C function often is a 'return', reminding us that in the background, the stack is restored and control is given to the caller.\n\nUnary incr/decrement Confusion🔗\nThe standard way to increment a variable in C:\n\nIn Rust, this works differently:\n\nThis prevents such C chaos:\n\nSwitch-Case is no Match for Patterns🔗\nPattern matching in Rust takes advantage of expression blocks quite beautifully:\n\nEvery match arm must evaluate to the same type (&amp;str here). The match arm can be any expression in a block that eventually evaluates to a &amp;str.\nThe patterns must be exhaustive!\nThis is like switch/case on steroids.\nLet's if let🔗\nTo destructure enums using if let is useful for ergonomic error handling with algebraic error types(Option, Result):\n\nThis works with any pattern, on enums, structs, and tuples.\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/statements-and-expressions-in-rust/","title":"Statements and Expressions in Rust"},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/stop-worrying-and-learn-to-loop-select/":{"body":"I can't seem to break from employing the loop-select! pattern.\nBut what should merely be an intra-task concurrency primitive combining pattern matching and futures has sparked heated discussions.\nWhile I begrudgingly acknowledge there are some footguns, here I'll advocate that actor-style programming likes the loop-select! (and so should you).\n\nNote: In my previous post, I have looked at actor-style programming from the outside. I have described my view of the preferrable public API of an actor, the influence of channels on the system architecture, and how to structure actors and full applications for \"natural actor shutdown\". These relate to this article, wherein I peek into the inner workings of what an actor can look like in tokio/rust.\n\nHang on - what's select!, again?🔗\nThe tokio::select! macro facilitates running several processes concurrently within one task.\nThese processes can have completely different objectives, but because they run concurrently,\nthey may share or even mutate the local variables among each other without any locks.\nWhile the docs on the tokio::select! macro have improved massively in the last few releases,\nhere is another attempt at a simplified description:\n\nStart several processes, and\noversee their progress.\nWhenever one finishes, determine if its output matches our expectations for it, then\n\n3a: if it did not, ignore the process, and go back to 2;\n3b: else, stop.\n\n\n\nThese processes, as you might imagine, are futures (1). Not tasks! Futures.\nThe select macro will (informedly) poll each future under its supervision (2).\nWhen a future is signalled to be woken, the macro will poll it (2).\nThis is not special, it is simply how futures are run.\nFinally, when a future returns Poll::Ready(T),\nthe resulting value is matched on a user-supplied pattern (3).\nIf the pattern does not match (3a), the macro disregards that process but continues monitoring the remaining ones.\nElse, all other processes (futures) are canceled (3b) and the macro evaluates to the value yielded by the future.\nExample 1: Explicit shutdown requires loop-select!🔗\nImagine an actor which periodically sends a message into the world.\nThis actor shall stop running only when you tell it to, via a cancellation token.\nNo need to resort to aborting a task using JoinHandle::abort!\nThe core of the Beacon actor could look like this:\n\nBecause the cancellation token and the interval are monitored concurrently, triggering the cancellation token will simply break the loop.\nIf it gets cancelled while the \"business logic\" is running, no problem - it will simply yield immediately on the next loop iteration.\n\nNote: This test pauses time. That's an incredibly neat feature of tests in tokio - they run in stop-time (faster than light, sometimes)!. It works by skipping over any operations which are explicitly \"sleeping\" (such as Interval::tick) if they are the only remaining operations right now.\n\n\nNote: The trait bounds allow us to abstract over the kind of I/O resource we are actually using. It could be a TCP socket, websocket, webtransport socket, (wrapped) channel sender, or any other implementor of the futures::Sink trait. One frequent pattern is to wrap an I/O resource implementing the AsyncWrite trait by some type which then implements the Sink trait. The codec module of tokio-util simplifies this pattern.\n\nFull example\nExample 2: loop-select! enables Implicit Shutdown🔗\nI don't think explicit shutdown is an anti-pattern, however usually I prefer implicit shutdown.\nImagine an actor similar to the previous one, which collects messages from a channel and sinks them into a TCP socket.\nAdditionally, it shall sink a specific (unchanging) message into the socket once per second.\nThe core of the Forwarder actor could look like this:\n\nI have previously argued that \"natural actor shutdown\" is \"best actor shutdown\".\nHere, we exit whenever the channel is closed naturally or in the unhappy case where our socket (sink) was closed remotely,\nin which case we also have no more work to do.\nThe other actors sending us messages may react to this, as they will observe the forwarders absence eventually (certainly when they try to send it something).\nFull example\nFootguns hiding in the dark🔗\nYou may have noticed I have papered over the details.\nIssue #1: Cancellation Safety🔗\nI stated that the futures in the competing concurrent branches of select! are simply dropped when another arm \"wins\".\nIf a future already internally commits some transaction (memory, network, database, whatever) before becoming Poll::Ready, and is then dropped,\nthe transaction will of course not be reverted.\nOr worse, if part of the transaction has happened, and the future is then dropped, the system may remain in an inconsistent state.\nMost futures in tokio are marked cancellation safe in the docs. In the ecosystem, that annotation is less pervasive.\nI haven't personally had problems with Cancellation Safety Violations (or am unaware), but it is something to keep in mind.\nIssue #2: A hidden panic🔗\nIn the examples above, we used select! to produce a value of type T.\nAnd in the sequence, I have outlined how an arm will get disabled when it resolves but the pattern does not match.\nSo what happens if all arms become disabled? A panic!.\n\nNote: That's because a panic! is one way to create a value of type T, by creating a value of type ! (the never type). The never type is the only subtype in Rust, and it's a subtype of every other type. There is even an impl From&lt;!&gt; for T somewhere, among other fun shenanigans.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nTo fix it in this case, you can just add a break as a select! arm:\n\nI like to match or let-else on the mpsc-arm of the select (there usually is one) and break there.\nIn other cases, one may want to break from the loop-select when reading an AsyncRead returns 0 (no more bytes to be had).\nFull example\nIssue #3: Easy to create an infinite busy loop🔗\nImagine having an actor to collect messages from three mpsc channels (for sake of example, it's not terribly important).\nOne could (I did) write such an event loop:\n\nOnce all channel handles have been dropped, every pattern always matches (even though it will always be None).\nThen, we get our useless tracing output, and finally, we start from top.\nI decided to include this example because busy loops like this are especially bad in an async world.\nThe only solace offered here is that the loop is async-busy, that is, at least it does not permanently hog the CPU.\nIt is busy in the sense that it can always run, but at least tokio won't let it suffocate the other tasks.\nFull example\nIssue #4: Tooling🔗\nRustfmt simply does not touch anything within a select, and Rust Analyzer also struggles with it.\nThat's not surprising, as the syntax is obviously invalid Rust to it.\nI like to take it as an incentive to create functions for all event handlers.\nHere's my recommended approach: in your select, only bother with message/event collection and shutdown.\nThe select, at the start of the event loop, shall only produce a value of a type Event or similar.\nThen, after collecting the event, a method on_event can be called.\n\nFull example\n","id":"https://barafael.github.io/posts/stop-worrying-and-learn-to-loop-select/","title":"Stop Worrying and Learn to Loop-Select"}},"docInfo":{"https://barafael.github.io/":{"body":1,"title":2},"https://barafael.github.io/about/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-2-initial-commit/":{"body":17,"title":2},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-3-negating-minimum-representable-number-in-twos-complement/":{"body":277,"title":6},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/2017-10-8-vim-has-no-keyboard-shortcuts/":{"body":251,"title":3},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/a-platform-agnostic-driver-for-ebyte-e32-lora-modules/":{"body":222,"title":7},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/a-platform-agnostic-driver-for-the-cd74hc4067/":{"body":221,"title":4},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/a-platform-agnostic-driver-for-the-hc12-serial-radio-module/":{"body":144,"title":7},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/exploring-the-precision-of-floating-point-numbers/":{"body":266,"title":5},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/fourier-transform-of-cosine-function/":{"body":186,"title":4},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/how-the-rust-compiler-prevents-mistakes/":{"body":869,"title":4},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/how-to-communicate-failure-in-rust/":{"body":178,"title":3},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/impulse-response-and-transfer-function/":{"body":350,"title":4},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/load-bearing-oneliners-in-the-rust-standard-library/":{"body":136,"title":6},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/more-actors-with-tokio/":{"body":1126,"title":3},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/nice-error-handling-with-arduino-blinking-led-patterns/":{"body":124,"title":7},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/object-oriented-arduino-interrupts-using-c-friend-functions/":{"body":180,"title":8},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/programming-the-teensy-3-2-using-a-makefile/":{"body":284,"title":5},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/remote-control-vehicle-balance-controller/":{"body":1065,"title":5},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/statements-and-expressions-in-rust/":{"body":259,"title":3},"https://barafael.github.io/posts/stop-worrying-and-learn-to-loop-select/":{"body":654,"title":5}},"length":22},"lang":"English"}
